# Introduction #

[AdWhirl](https://www.adwhirl.com) is not another ad network, so, if you want ads in your app, you have to still configure an ad network (for example [AdMob](http://www.admob.com/)). What [AdWhirl](https://www.adwhirl.com) provides is an easy way to interact with multiple ad networks. For more information, please read the [AdWhirl general questions](http://helpcenter.adwhirl.com/content/general-questions) page.

## Pros ##

  * Manage ad networks for your applications in a unified web app.
  * Automatically rotates between configured ad networks when one of them fails (for example, lack of inventory).
  * Create your own house ads.
  * [Free and open source](http://code.google.com/p/adwhirl/).

## Cons ##

  * You still have to create accounts for each ad network and configure them.
  * You still have to add and configure the respective SDK of each ad network in your app.
