# LibGDX Api documentation #


## online ##

You can browse the documentation online:

http://libgdx.l33tlabs.org/docs/api/


## online (out-of-date) ##

In case the online documentation is down you can try this (**out-of-date!**) version:

http://libgdx.googlecode.com/svn/!svn/bc/1148/api/index.html


## nightlies ##

If you need the most recent documentation you find it shipping with the nightlies' zip file. See folder

docs/api/

(sometimes that folder is empty, though ...?!)


## Eclipse ##

If you link the gdx-sources.jar to your project (see tab in project -> properties -> Java build path) you can have the corresponding libGDX source file opened or method focused by pressing **F3** in Eclipse after you clicked a keyword (classname, varibale).
You can also just hover the mouse over it. A tooltip showing javadoc will pop up.


## last resort ##

As a last resort you could open the appropriate `*`source`*`.jar included in the nightlies zip file and browse them in a text-editor and read the javadoc that is embedded there. :-/
