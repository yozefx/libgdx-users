# Particle system #

Particles are efficient way to produce progmatic animation for certain cases.

Wikipedia says: The term particle system refers to a computer graphics technique to simulate certain fuzzy phenomena, which are otherwise very hard to reproduce with conventional rendering techniques. Examples of such phenomena which are commonly replicated using particle systems include fire, explosions, smoke, moving water, sparks, falling leaves, clouds, fog, snow, dust, meteor tails, hair, fur, grass, or abstract visual effects like glowing trails, magic spells, etc.

In Libgdx one particle system is particle effect that contain one or more particle emitters. Particle emitter have certain predefined attributes like duration, emission, particle image and spawning shape. Particle emitter produce parcticles that have certain predefined attributes like speed, angle and color.(there is lot more)

Easiest way to make parcticle effects is with editor. There you can see how different atributes affect to effect. These attributes can also be altered programatically ingame.
