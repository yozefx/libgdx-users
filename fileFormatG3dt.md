# G3DT #

LibGDX own text based file format for both still and keyframed (animated) models.

There is an export script for [Blender](Blender.md).


A method how to convert g3dt to [g3d](fileFormatG3d.md) is described on the tutorial about [Importing Models e.g. from Blender](ImportingModelsFromBlender.md).
