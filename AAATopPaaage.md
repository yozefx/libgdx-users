# You Found Us! #
<font size='2'><b>Welcome to the libGDX-Users wiki.</b></font> We have prepared a veritable smorgasboard of documentation for the libGDX project. The libGDX docs are available through both this wiki, and the official non-Users libGDX wiki at the [libGDX Homepage](http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/) We endeavor to keep external (including the Homepage) links as up-to-date as possible, but if you see anything that we missed, then please, let us know. Also, **be sure check out the Table of Contents in the sidebar on the left.**

## Not Sure What You Found? ##

You may want to have a gander at the [libGDX Homepage](http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/).

## [Development Environment](EnvironmentSetup.md) ##
<font size='2'><b>First things first!</b></font> We'll give you all the details on **where to find the latest libGDX binaries**, how to setup a project that references your newly downloaded binaries, and finally, how to make this new project **execute on both a desktop machine, and an Android device** (or emulator).

## [Tutorials](TutorialList.md) ##
<font size='2'><b>General concepts, and established procedures, with a smattering of useful tips.</b></font> The tutorials are split into three categories: basic, intermediate, and advanced.

## [Common Tasks and How-Tos](TaskList.md) ##
<font size='2'><b>This comprehensive list of Common Tasks and How-Tos will probably get you up and running in the shortest amount of time.</b></font> If you have a question that isn't covered in a tutorial, then there's a good chance that it IS covered in a Task or How-To.

## [Glossary](Glossary.md) ##
<font size='2'><b>OMG! WHAT'S A TEXEL!?</b></font> You don't have to feel lost in a sea of nouns, adjectives, and verbs any more! **We have answers!**

## [libGDX Feature Demos](DemoList.md) ##
<font size='2'><b>Hungry for some code? Well, we whipped up a batch of sample'du'jour, just for you!</b></font> These feature demos are split up into many small projects, which allows each of them to focus on explaining and presenting a small subset of the the many features exposed by the libGDX library. Included are SpriteBatches, Decals, 2D User Interfaces, Transitions (Tweening), and much more!

## [Games that Use libGDX](GamesList.md) ##
<font size='2'><b>libGDX is definitely worthwhile, just ask the developers of all these games!</b></font> This list is not comprehensive, but is definitely good for gauging the usefulness

## External Links ##
<font size='2'><b>We try, but we don't have ALL the answers... but we know who does!</b></font> Tools, blogs, and links to the official libGDX docs.
