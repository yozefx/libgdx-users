## Notes on importing into Eclipse ##

Importing demo projects into Eclipse in this order:

  1. import demos-android
  1. import demos-desktop

After importing, remove New\_configuration from

Right mouse button on Project "demos-android" -> Properties -> "Run/Debug Settings"
(left click "New\_configuration" to the right and then "Delete", then "OK")

The missing gen/ folder is automatically generated by Eclipse (or Android SDK plugin) on first launch of the android project).
