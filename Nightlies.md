# Nightlies #

Nighlies are build once a day at 00:00 midnight, local server time.

The nightlies' server is located in the U.S. (Michigan) and it is using this as server's time zone.


## Example ##

What does it mean for people from other timezones with respect to the included source changes from [1](1.md) if the nightlies timestamp says "30-Aug-2011 00:05"?


Q: What is the threshold for those "changes" notices (http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/source/list) if you want to be sure that they are included in the available nightlies download?

A: Nightlies hosting server is located in the U.S. (Michigan) which has UTC/GMT -4 hours ATM. If I have UTC/GMT +2 hours then nightlies were build 06:00 AM (my local time).<br />
If it was 11:00 AM here right now I can consider all "changes" that are timestamped as more than "5 hours ago" ago as included in the libs.

# Building .jar files yourself #

Of course you can always build the jars out of SVN sources yourself with some amount of work:
