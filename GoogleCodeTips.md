## wiki in git ##
the wiki exists in a separate git project so examples can be edited offline.

` libgdx-users.wiki `

you can check it out with

` git clone https://[USERNAME]@code.google.com/p/libgdx-users.wiki `

## git password ##
google code generates a password but you can also set it up to use your google account ID password
https://code.google.com/hosting/settings

```
Security
Accept [USERNAME]@gmail.com Google Account password when using a Git or Mercurial client. 
```

## images in the wiki ##
google code wiki doesnt have a simple way to upload images, but you can link to an image anywhere on the web by just surrounding the URL with square brackets.

we are also adding images to the git repo and then they can be displayed inline in the wiki like this:

![http://wiki.libgdx-users.googlecode.com/git/images/gdx-logos/logo-128.png](http://wiki.libgdx-users.googlecode.com/git/images/gdx-logos/logo-128.png)

If you want to add some images, probably the easiest thing is to use a host like [www.ImageShack.com] or [www.PhotoBucket.com] and then just link to the uploaded image. you can do that almost instantly...
