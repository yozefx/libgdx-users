# box2d #

Very popular physics library, libGDX has a lightning fast implementation of this.

## Timestep / World step ##

What is it?

A fixed time step is recommended!

A frame rate of 45 (timestep= 1/45) is fine on galaxy s s2 and recent htc devices. U can make a simple if(desktop) step=1/300 else step=1/45

## vertice count on polygonal shapes ##

Q: Why is not possible to create polygonal shape with Box2D which has more than 8 vertices?

A: More than 8 vertices is more likely to create 180Â° angles between two edges, and box2d collision detection sometimes has troubles with these angles. If you need more than 8 vertices, create multiple fixtures for a single body. Each fixture defines one shape, but there is no limit on how many fixtures can be added to a single body.
