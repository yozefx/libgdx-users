There are two flavors of camera in libGDX: Orthographic and Perspective Camera.

2D and 3D notions, viewport setup and projections:

## Orthographic Camera ##

Orthographic Camera uses parallel projection which ignores objects z-values. Object's width and height does not change when changing z-value.

The OrthographicCamera is a wrapper for orthographic projection used in 2D graphics:

## Perspective Camera ##

Perspective Camera uses perspective projection where object's width and height changes according to the objects' z-value as it is experienced in real world.


## Isometric View ##

Special "pseudo 3D" setting where camera looks at scene from a double 45Â° angle (sideways, upwards).
