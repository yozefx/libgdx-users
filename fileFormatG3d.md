# G3D #

LibGDX own binary file format for both still and keyframed (animated) models.

There is an export script for [Blender](Blender.md).


A method how to convert [g3dt](fileFormatG3dt.md) to g3d is described on the tutorial about [Importing Models e.g. from Blender](ImportingModelsFromBlender.md).
