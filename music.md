# Music with libGDX #

(also see [MidiPlayerInterface](MidiPlayerInterface.md))

"jetplayer" is an open source app for android. You could get some ideas from that. Jetplayer switches between tunes based on events in your app or game.


# Sound with libGDX #

Ogg is a good choice as asset format (small filesize, good sound).

Adding a singleton asset manager can make sure the sound is loaded.

Also use singleton SoundResource.
