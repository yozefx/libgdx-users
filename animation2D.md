# Universal Tween Engine #

In case you need to animate anything outside the scene2d package, you can also have a look at the Universal Tween Engine. That's a custom library Obli built for libgdx. It has (roughly) the same syntax as the TweenMax Flash/AS3 library, and can be used with anything: Sprites, Cameras, Actors, 3D Meshes, etc.
